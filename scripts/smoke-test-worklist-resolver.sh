# Smoke test for /__worklist/resolve consume-on-read behavior (issue #63).
#
# Run from within a Bram PTY shell, where BRAM_PORT (or legacy
# XMLUI_DESKTOP_PORT) is exported into the environment.
#
# Backs up resources/.worklist-authorization.json, writes synthetic records,
# curls the resolver, and asserts the response shapes. Restores the backup
# on exit (success, failure, or interrupt) via a trap.
#
# Scenario 1 — approved consume-on-read:
#   - first GET returns kind=approved
#   - second GET returns kind=no_active_authorization with consumedAtMs set
#
# Scenario 2 — drop is NOT consumed by the resolver:
#   - repeated GETs keep returning kind=drop
#   - (the enforcement path in maybe_enforce_worklist_policy is what consumes
#     drop, which is intentionally not exercised here)
